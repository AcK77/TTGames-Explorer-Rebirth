	/// OpcodeToken0 is followed by 2 operands on Shader Models 4.0 through 5.0:
	/// (1) an operand, starting with OperandToken0, defining which

	/// (2) a Resource Return Type token (ResourceReturnTypeToken)
	///
	/// OpcodeToken0 is followed by 3 operands on Shader Model 5.1 and later:
	/// (1) an operand, starting with OperandToken0, defining which
	///     t# register (D3D10_SB_OPERAND_TYPE_RESOURCE) is being declared.
	///     The indexing dimension for the register must be D3D10_SB_OPERAND_INDEX_DIMENSION_3D, 
	///     and the meaning of the index dimensions are as follows: (t<id>[<lbound>:<ubound>])
	///       1 <id>:     variable ID being declared
	///       2 <lbound>: the lower bound of the range of resources in the space
	///       3 <ubound>: the upper bound (inclusive) of this range
	///     As opposed to when the t# is used in shader instructions, where the register
	///     must be D3D10_SB_OPERAND_INDEX_DIMENSION_2D, and the meaning of the index 
	///     dimensions are as follows: (t<id>[<idx>]):
	///       1 <id>:  variable ID being used (matches dcl)
	///       2 <idx>: absolute index of resource within space (may be dynamically indexed)
	/// (2) a Resource Return Type token (ResourceReturnTypeToken)
	/// (3) a DWORD indicating the space index.
